                                This project was aimed 
to develop a full fledged home automation and security system using raspberry pi and 
telegram mobile application which is cheaper than the existing ones.

                                A face detection using convolutional neural network In this project I have first took the images reshaped them and then numbered it as 1 and 0 if the person is s1 and if the person is s2. Then stored them in a file and feed to my neural network, my network consists of two sets of convolutional , activation and max pooling layers ,then a dense layer with 64 units and finally a dense layer and activation with SoftMax classifier.
